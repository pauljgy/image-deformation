# playing with ways to deform one image into another.

learned about wasserstein distances for optimal transport + probability theory, and turns out the family of distances is important in machine learning + images. 

here i'm just trying a couple of methods of interpolating between two images:
- wasserstein geodesic
- simple linear interpolation
